@subheading Two LilyPond projects in Google Summer of Code 2016  @emph{April 23, 2016}

We are happy to see two students, Nathan Chou and Jeffery Shivers, working on
LilyPond as participants in the Google Summer of Code this year.  We hope they
produce great results and stay in the developer community afterwards.

Nathan will tackle an annoying limitation, namely the unability of spanners
to cross voices.  His work will make a class of ugly workarounds obsolete.
Jeffery will bring the ScholarLY package[1] to production quality and add a
LaTeX package to it, making it possible to create beautiful critical reports
from data encoded directly in the LilyPond score.

@subheading LilyPond 2.18.0 released!  @emph{December 29, 2013}

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.0.
LilyPond is a music engraving program devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of
traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.

Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might
be most visible:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
than a@tie{}rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces
the occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

@item
Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
@end example
instead of the previous
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
@end example

@item
Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
@example
\tuplet 3/2 4 @{ c8 c c  c c c @}
@end example
instead of
@example
\times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}  \times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}
@end example
@end itemize

A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

Great thanks go to the large number of LilyPond enthusiasts whose
financial backing enabled one core developer, David Kastrup, to
focus exclusively on LilyPond during the entire development cycle.
